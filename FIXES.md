## New Files Created
1. `sw.js` - Service worker for caching and offline functionality
2. `error.html` - Fallback page for resource loading issues
3. `404.html` - Custom 404 error page with branding and functionality
4. `test-404.html` - Testing page for 404 functionality
5. `.htaccess` - Server configuration for optimization

## Modified Files
1. `index.html` - Enhanced with error handling and fallbacks
2. `main.js` - Complete rewrite with proper error handling
3. `style.css` - Added font fallbacks and better responsive design
4. `robots.txt` - Updated to allow necessary resources
5. `sitemap.xml` - Updated with proper dates

## Key Improvements

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with network throttling to simulate slow connections
2. Test with blocked CDNs to verify fallbacks work
3. Verify service worker caching in developer tools
4. Test form submission with various network conditions
5. Validate Google Analytics tracking is working

## Monitoring
- Check Google Search Console for reduced errors
- Monitor Core Web Vitals improvements
- Track service worker cache hit rates
- Monitor JavaScript error rates in analytics

All changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving reliability and performance.
